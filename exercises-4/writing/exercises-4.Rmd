The *vinho verde* wine from northern Portugal is formulated from 11 different chemical properties. Using data from 6500 different bottles of red and white wine and their individual chemical makeup and quality rating, how can we methodologically distinguish the red from the white wine and the low-quality from the high-quality wine? 


#### **PCA**
First, let's try Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to distinguish the different bottles of wine among the data. When we group the data by the color of wine, we can summarize the average amount of each chemical property and average quality rating for each color of wine (as shown below). 

<br>

**Average amounts by color of wine** 

|                      | Red   | White  |
|----------------------|-------|--------|
| Fixed Acidity        |  8.32 |   6.85 |
| Volatile Acidity     |  0.53 |   0.28 |
| Citric Acid          |  0.27 |   0.33 |
| Residual Sugar       |  2.54 |   6.39 |
| Chlorides            |  0.09 |   0.05 |
| Free Sulfur Dioxide  | 15.87 |  35.31 |
| Total Sulfur Dioxide | 46.47 | 138.36 |
| Density              |  1.00 |   0.99 |
| pH                   |  3.31 |   3.19 |
| Sulphates            |  0.66 |   0.49 |
| Alcohol              | 10.42 |  10.51 |
| Quality              |  5.64 |   5.88 |

Some chemical properties seem to have consistent average levels across both colors of wine, while some properties seem to have very different average levels. The most noteworthy difference across colors of wine, is the average level of total sulfur dioxide. Red wine has an average of about 46.47 units of total sulfur dioxide, while white wine has an average of about 138.36 units. 

When we look at the correlation of these chemical components from this average summary, we can visualize  which groups of components tend to have similar/opposite levels. 

<br>

```{r corrplot, echo=FALSE}
ggcorrplot::ggcorrplot(cor(wine_results), hc.order = TRUE)
```

We can clearly see a perfect correlation
between two groups of wine components. Residual sugar, citric acid, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, alcohol, and quality are all perfectly correlated with each other. Meanwhile, volatile acidity, fixed acidity, chlorides, density, pH, and sulphates are all perfectly correlated with each other. So, the chemical components do seem to appear in two distinct groups. 

Moreover, when we run PCA,
we get two distinct principal component groups (as seen below). 

<br>

**PCA Results** 

|                      | PC1   | PC2   |
|----------------------|-------|-------|
| Fixed Acidity        |  0.29 | -0.39 |
| Volatile Acidity     |  0.29 | -0.08 |
| Citric Acid          | -0.29 | -0.79 |
| Residual Sugar       | -0.29 | -0.04 |
| Chlorides            |  0.29 |  0.04 |
| Free Sulfur Dioxide  | -0.29 |  0.15 |
| Total Sulfur Dioxide | -0.29 | -0.12 |
| Density              |  0.29 |  0.04 |
| pH                   |  0.29 |  0.04 |
| Sulphates            |  0.29 | -0.41 |
| Alcohol              | -0.29 |  0.08 |
| Quality              | -0.29 | -0.04 |


<br>

Applying the PCA results to the two different colors of wine, we get:

|       | PC1   | PC2      |
|-------|-------|----------|
| White | -2.45 | 4.96e-16 |
| Red   |  2.45 | 7.29e-16 |

We can see that PC1 is positively associated with red wine, indicating that PC1 likely differentiates on color of wine. Meanwhile, PC2 is positively correlated with both colors of wine, but is slightly bigger for red wine, indicating PC2 may differentiate on a combination of some chemical properties or quality. 

<br>

Now, we can use principal component regression to better analyze the differentiating power of PCA. First, we can regress wine quality onto PC1 and PC2, and get:

```{r glm1, echo=FALSE}
lm1
```
PC2 is dropped from the model due to multiocollinearity in the model. This is to be expected considering the chemical properties were perfectly correlated with each other. This regression analysis tells us that a positive association with PC1 is predicted to decrease quality, on average, by about 0.049 units. Red wine is more positively associated with PC1 and has a slightly lower average quality than white wine, so these regression results makes sense. 

<br>

Then, we can regress wine color onto PC1 and PC2, and get:

```{r glm2, echo=FALSE}
lm2
```
This tells us that a positive association with PC1 is predicted to increase the probability that a bottle of wine is red by about 20%. Once again, this is consistent with our previous analysis of the principal components for each color of wine. 

Based on the principal component regression analysis, this dimensionality reduction technique appears to be successful in differentiating color and quality of wine. 

<br>

#### **Clustering**

Next, let's analyze the performance of hierarchical clustering in differentiating wine color and quality. Using the best performing hierarchical clustering method (maximum distance), we can summarize how the data is clustered into five different groups: 

```{r clustering1, echo=FALSE}
summary(factor(cluster2))
```
The data is mostly clustered into group 1, with some decreasing numbers as we get to group 5. Because of the uneven spread of data points across the clusters, it is unlikely that the clusters represent clear groups of different colors or quality of wine. However, now that the data is grouped, we can analyze what properties the clustering method used to differentiate the data into each cluster. Specifically, we can analyze if clusters clearly distinguish between color and/or quality of the wine. 

<br>

```{r clusterplot1, echo=FALSE}
plot(cluster_quality_plot)
```

This plot shows the spread of observations from each cluster across the different levels of quality. No cluster appears to adhere to one quality of rating (high/low quality), so we can see that no cluster clearly differentiates wine by its quality rating.  

<br>

```{r clusterplot2, echo=FALSE}
plot(cluster_color_plot)
```

This plot shows the spread of observations from each cluster across the different colors of wine. Once again, no cluster seems to make a clear distinction of one color of wine. While cluster 2 does only appear to be red wine, the cluster population isn't representative of all the bottles of red wine in the sample. So, some bottles of red wine may appear in one of the other 4 clusters, which don't differentiate by color. 


The hierarchical clustering technique does not succeed in accurately differentiating groups of wine by their color of their quality. Meanwhile, the PCA technique does provide accurate predictions in differentiating wine by these characteristics. Therefore,  the PCA technique makes more sense for this data. 
<br>

#### **Overview**
Understanding the target audience of a product is crucial to developing successful online-advertising campaigns. Such is the case for NutrientH20, a large consumer drinks brand. How can we identify and better reach the biggest NutrientH20 customer groups?

#### **Data & Model** 
In order understand the online-advertising customer base, NutrientH20's advertising team took a sample of the brand's Twitter followers and collected each user's posts("tweets") over a seven day period in June 2014. Then, every post was examined by a human annotator contracted through Amazon's Mechanical Turk service. Each tweet was categorized based on its content using a pre-specified scheme of 36 different categories, each representing a broad area of interest (e.g. politics, sports, family, etc.). 

Three of the 36 different tweet categories indicate a certain form of uninformative content: chatter, spam, and adult(adult content). In order to mitigate the bias of these uninformative categories, I only kept users with zero spam or adult content and only average levels of chatter. After filtering and cleaning, the data contains information on about 5,000 NutrientH20 Twitter followers. 

To differentiate each user into an identifiable customer group based on their Twitter content, I used hierarchical clustering. This unsupervised learning technique automatically groups users into different clusters based on similarities in user content. Then, each cluster can be analyzed to identify each NutrientH20 customer group. 

#### **Results**
First, we can see how many users are in each cluster:
```{r p2_summary, echo=FALSE}
summary(factor(cluster2))
```
We can clearly see that Cluster 1 is the biggest customer group. The spread across clusters if fairly uneven, and we can quickly identify Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 as being the two largest differentiated customer groups. 

Now, within each cluster, we can rank each content category from highest to lowest average count. This ranking can help identify the primary interests of each group, and help us understand how the customer group is differentiated from the rest. 

The following plots show the average counts of the top six ranked categories for each cluster. From these plots, we can visualize what the primary interests are of each group. 

```{r clust1plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(clust1_plot)
```

Cluster 1, the largest customer group, posts content mostly related to health/nutrition and general chatter. 

```{r clust2plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(clust2_plot)
```

Cluster 2, the second largest customer group, is mostly interested in content related to sports(fandom for a sport/team) and religion. 

```{r clust4plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(clust4_plot)
```

Cluster 4, the third largest customer group, is mostly interested in content related to cooking and fashion. 

```{r clust3plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(clust3_plot)
```

Meanwhile, Cluster 3, the smallest customer group, is mostly interested in politics and travel. 

Each cluster does appear to have unique interests that clearly differentiate their customer profile from the rest.

#### **Conclusion**
Based on the category analysis for each cluster, we can identify NutrientH20's biggest customer group and their primary interests. The two largest customer group make up about 98% of the total customer sample, so NutrientH20 should really hone in on the few key interests of the two largest clusters. 

The largest NutrientH20 audience for is users focused on their health and nutrition and who are likely active on social media (a large interest in chatter). The next biggest NutrientH20 audience is users interested in sports and religion. The combination of these top interests suggests a primary customer base comprised of young and active consumers. So, with a focus on health/nutrition, social media engagement, sports, and religious ideals, NutrientH20 can better reach its customer base through online-marketing messages.

####
# Data pre-preprocessing
####

# Turn shopper into a factor
groceries$shopper = factor(groceries$shopper)
view(groceries)
# First create a list of baskets: vectors of items by consumer

# apriori algorithm expects a list of baskets in a special format.
# it's a bit finicky!
# In this case, one "basket" of items per user
# First split data into a list of items for each shopper
groceries_split = split(x=groceries$item, f=groceries$shopper)

# the first users's basket, the second user's etc
# note the [[ ]] indexing, this is how you extract
# numbered elements of a list in R
groceries_split[[1]]  # first user's playlist
groceries_split[[2]]  # second user's playlist

## Remove duplicates ("de-dupe")
# lapply says "apply a function to every element in a list"
# unique says "extract the unique elements" (i.e. remove duplicates)
groceries_split = lapply(groceries_split, unique)

## Cast this resulting list of baskets as a special arules "transactions" class.
baskettrans = as(groceries_split, "transactions")
summary(baskettrans)

# Now run the 'apriori' algorithm
# Look at rules with support > .01 & confidence >.1 & length (# artists) <= 5
groceryrules = apriori(baskettrans, 
                     parameter=list(support=.01, confidence=.1, maxlen=2))

# plot all the rules in (support, confidence) space
# notice that high lift rules tend to have low support
plot(groceryrules)

# can swap the axes and color scales
plot(groceryrules, measure = c("support", "lift"), shading = "confidence")

# "two key" plot: coloring is by size (order) of item set
twokey_plot =plot(groceryrules, method='two-key plot')

# can now look at subsets driven by the plot

```

#### **Overview**
Can we define association rules for grocery shopping? How does picking on item affect the probability of putting another item in your shopping cart? We can define association rules for these relationships to understand how certain buying behavior increases the probability of future behavior. 

#### **Data & Model**
We have data on about 9,800 different grocery shoppers and every purchased item from their grocery basket. 

In order create associative relationship between the items in a shoppers cart, I use an association rules model to define the support, confidence, and lift between two product purchases. From these relationships, we can better understand what products are most frequently purchased, and the probability of what other products will be purchased in addition.

#### **Results**
Looking at a two-key plot of the grocery baskets for each shopper, we can understand the spread of support, confidence, and lift of each item relationship in the dataset:

```{r p3_plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(twokey_plot)
```

Looking at the plot, we can see that most support is starts at about 0.02 and increases from there, and the confidence starts at around 0.1 and increases. These levels of confidence and support will serve as parameter thresholds for the association rules. 

Using these parameter thresholds, we can define association rules across different grocery items, and ultimately build a network of relationships:

From the network, we can see that whole milk, other vegetables, and rolls/buns are the most popular and integral items in the association network. The association rules with the highest lift, are items in relation to these three products. For example, the association of a shopper that bought butter then buying whole milk has a lift of about 2-2.25. 

#### **Conclusion**
From the network of association rules, we can better understand grocery shopping behavior and how it affects future purchases. The most popular and central items are whole milk, vegetables, and rolls/buns. It makes sense that these products are so integral to the grocery shopping rules, because they are all perishable and frequently consumed items. So, we would expect these items to be on most shoppers' weekly shopping list. Therefore, when shoppers buy these perishable goods, it increases the probability that they are also going to purchase more perishable produce or bread such as butter, fruit, or pastries.
